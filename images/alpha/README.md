This image contains the Stencila packages for [Node.js](https://github.com/stencila/node), [Python](https://github.com/stencila/python) and [R](https://github.com/stencila/r) (which allows you to author documents containing code in these languages) as well as a large number of system libraries and packages for scientific computing. It aims to provide a computing environment that meets the needs of 95% of research documents.

If you are reading this within a container then you should be able to interact with the following code blocks writen in various coding languages.
