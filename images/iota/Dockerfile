# A base image that attempts to be as small as possible
# while still providing a Stencila Host within the container.
#
# Intended for use during development to provide a quick to
# pull container image. But provides limited functionalty (ie. no R or Python)
#
# Currently, the smallest way to provide a Stencila Host is
# to install Node and the `stencila-node` package.
# But in the future could involve a binary executable compiled
# from C++ or Go or some other language.

FROM node:alpine

# There is already a guest user so just use its home
WORKDIR /home/guest

# Set the HOME env var so that untildify works
ENV HOME /home/guest

# Unfortunately, `stencila-node` is dependent upon `canvas`
# which requires `node-gyp` and Python to be installed. Those
# depenedncies may be able to be removed in the future.
